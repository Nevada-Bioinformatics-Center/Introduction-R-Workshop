Welcome to the Introduction to R Workshop by the Nevada Bioinformatics Center with support from the NV INBRE Data Science Core. This workshop is designed to get you started with R programming for data analysis and statistics.

## Workshop Overview

This hands-on workshop introduces participants to the R programming language and RStudio development environment. You'll learn essential skills for data manipulation and exploration using R's powerful tools and packages.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:
- Install and navigate R and RStudio
- Understand fundamental R concepts and data structures
- Import, explore, and manipulate data using base R and tidyverse packages
- Apply data transformation techniques using dplyr and tidyr
- Organize and manage R projects effectively

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- No prior programming experience required

### During the Workshop
1. Open the HTML versions of each module for easier reading
2. Follow along with the instructor using the R Markdown (.Rmd) files
3. Practice with the provided examples and exercises
4. Ask questions - learning is collaborative!

## Sample Data

This workshop uses several datasets for hands-on practice:
- **Built-in R datasets:** `mtcars`, `iris`, and others
- **Workshop dataset:** `subset_FFQ.csv` - A sample food frequency questionnaire dataset

## Required Software

- **R** (version 4.0 or higher) - Download from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- **RStudio** - Download from [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

### Key R Packages
The workshop covers installation and use of these essential packages:
- `tidyverse` - A collection of data science packages
    - `dplyr` - Data manipulation
    - `tidyr` - Data tidying and reshaping
    - `ggplot2` - Sophisticated data visualizations
    - many more 


## Why Learn R?

### Reproducible Analysis
Create scripts that document your entire analysis process, making your work transparent and easy to replicate.

### Powerful and Flexible
Access to thousands of packages for everything from basic statistics to machine learning, with specialized tools for various fields.

### Excellent Graphics
Create publication-quality visualizations with fine-grained control over every aspect of your plots.

### Free and Open Source
No licensing fees, with a supportive community and transparent development process.

## Getting Help
