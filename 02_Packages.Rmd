## Introduction

In this lesson, we'll learn about R packages that make data manipulation easier and more intuitive. While base R is powerful, packages like `dplyr` and `tidyr` provide functions that are specifically designed for common data analysis tasks.

Packages are like toolboxes - base R gives you basic tools, but specialized packages give you power tools that make specific jobs much easier and faster.

## R packages

R packages are collections of functions, data, and documentation that extend R's capabilities. The `tidyverse` is a collection of packages designed to work together seamlessly for data science tasks.

### Installing and loading packages

Before we can use a package, we need to install it (once) and load it (every session):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Install the tidyverse (only need to do this once)
install.packages("tidyverse")

```


## What is the tidyverse?

The **tidyverse** is a collection of R packages designed to make data science tasks easier, more consistent, and more readable. These packages are built to work together and share a common philosophy and grammar.

Some of the most important tidyverse packages are:

- **dplyr**: for data manipulation (filtering, selecting, summarizing, etc.)
- **tidyr**: for reshaping and tidying data
- **ggplot2**: for data visualization
- **readr**: for reading data files (like CSVs)
- **tibble**: for modern, user-friendly data frames
- **stringr**: for working with text (strings)
- **forcats**: for working with categorical data (factors)

All tidyverse packages use a similar style:
- They work with **tibbles** (a modern version of data frames)
- They use **verbs** (functions) like `select()`, `filter()`, `mutate()`, and `summarize()` to describe what you want to do with your data
- They use the **pipe operator** (`%>%`) to chain together multiple steps in a readable way

**Why learn the tidyverse?**  
Once you learn the core tidyverse verbs and the pipe operator, you can use them across almost all tidyverse packages. This makes it much easier to learn new packages and work with data in a consistent way.

> **Tip:** The tidyverse is not just for advanced users—it's designed to make R easier and more intuitive for everyone!

---

Now, let's look at some of the most useful tidyverse functions for data manipulation, starting with `dplyr`.

```{r}
# Load tidyverse for this session
library(tidyverse)

# Load our practice data
data(mtcars)
data(iris)
```


## Learning `dplyr`

![](fig/dplyr.png)

`dplyr` provides a grammar of data manipulation. It gives us a set of functions that help us solve the most common data manipulation challenges.

The main `dplyr` functions are:

- `select()` - pick columns
- `filter()` - pick rows
- `mutate()` - create new columns
- `arrange()` - reorder rows
- `group_by()` - group data for analysis
- `summarize()` - calculate summary statistics

Let's explore each one with examples.

### `select()` - Choosing columns

When you work with data, you often have tables (data frames) with many columns, but you only need to focus on a few for your analysis. The `select()` function from `dplyr` helps you easily pick out just the columns you want to keep.

**Why use `select()`?**
- To simplify your data and focus only on the variables you care about
- To make your code and results easier to read
- To avoid mistakes by removing unnecessary columns

**How does it work?**
You tell `select()` which columns you want, and it gives you a new data frame with just those columns. You can specify columns by their names or by their positions.

For example, if you have a data frame with 10 columns but only want to look at "mpg" and "hp", you can use `select()` to keep just those two.

Now, let's see some examples:

```{r}
# Look at the original mtcars data
head(mtcars)

# Select just a few columns
mtcars_simple <- select(mtcars, mpg, hp, wt)
head(mtcars_simple)

# Select columns by position
select(mtcars, 1:3)

# Select all columns except certain ones
select(mtcars, -cyl, -disp)

# Select columns that start with a letter
select(mtcars, starts_with("c"))  # cyl and carb
```

### `filter()` - Choosing rows

`filter()` lets you keep only rows that meet certain conditions. This is like subsetting but with cleaner syntax.

```{r}
# Filter cars with high fuel efficiency
high_mpg <- filter(mtcars, mpg > 25)
high_mpg

# Filter with multiple conditions (AND)
efficient_powerful <- filter(mtcars, mpg > 20, hp > 100)
head(efficient_powerful)

# Filter with OR conditions
filter(mtcars, mpg > 30 | hp > 250)

# Filter based on categorical data
filter(iris, Species == "setosa")
```

### `mutate()` - Creating new columns

`mutate()` adds new columns to your data frame, often based on existing columns. This is perfect for calculating new variables.

```{r}
# Create a new column for horsepower per weight
mtcars_new <- mutate(mtcars, hp_per_weight = hp / wt)
head(select(mtcars_new, hp, wt, hp_per_weight))

# Create multiple new columns at once
mtcars_enhanced <- mutate(mtcars,
                         hp_per_weight = hp / wt,
                         is_efficient = mpg > 20,
                         weight_kg = wt * 453.592)  # convert to kg

head(select(mtcars_enhanced, mpg, hp, wt, hp_per_weight, is_efficient, weight_kg))

# Mutate can use columns you just created
mtcars_mutated <- mutate(mtcars, 
                        weight_tons = wt / 2,
                        hp_per_ton = hp / (wt / 2))
head(select(mtcars_mutated, hp, wt, weight_tons, hp_per_ton))
```


### `arrange()` - Sorting rows

`arrange()` sorts your data based on one or more columns. By default, it sorts in ascending order.

```{r}
# Sort by miles per gallon (lowest to highest)
head(arrange(mtcars, mpg))

# Sort by miles per gallon (highest to lowest)
head(arrange(mtcars, desc(mpg)))

# Sort by multiple columns
head(arrange(mtcars, cyl, desc(mpg)))

```

### `count()` - Counting occurrences

`count()` is a quick way to count how many times each value appears in a column.

```{r}
# Count cars by number of cylinders
count(mtcars, cyl)

# Count by multiple variables
count(mtcars, cyl, gear)

# Count and sort
count(mtcars, cyl, sort = TRUE)

# With iris data
count(iris, Species)
```

### Pipes (`%>%`) - Chaining operations

The pipe operator `%>%` lets you chain multiple operations together. Read it as "then do". This makes your code more readable and easier to follow.

**What is a pipe?**  
The pipe takes the result from the left side and passes it as the first argument to the function on the right side. This allows you to write a sequence of data steps in the order you would describe them. This makes your code:

- Easier to read and write
- Avoids lots of nested parentheses
- Lets you build up your analysis step by step

**How to read a pipe chain:**  
`mtcars %>% select(mpg, hp) %>% filter(mpg > 20)`  
means:  
“Take mtcars, then select mpg and hp, then keep only rows where mpg > 20.”

**Tip:**  
You can break a long pipe chain into multiple lines for clarity.  
RStudio will automatically indent the next line after a pipe.

**Common mistake:**  
Don’t forget to load the `tidyverse` or `dplyr` package, or `%>%` won’t work!


**Without pipes** (hard to read):
```{r}
# Hard to read - working from inside out
result <- arrange(
  filter(
    select(mtcars, mpg, hp, wt), 
    mpg > 20
  ), 
  desc(hp)
)
head(result)
```

**With pipes** (much clearer):
```{r}
# Easy to read - working from left to right
mtcars %>%
  select(mpg, hp, wt) %>%
  filter(mpg > 20) %>%
  arrange(desc(hp)) %>%
  head()
```

The pipe takes the result from the left side and passes it as the first argument to the function on the right side.

### `group_by()` and `summarize()` - Grouped analysis

These functions work together to perform calculations on groups within your data. This is incredibly powerful for analysis.

`group_by()` divides your data into groups, and `summarize()` calculates statistics for each group.

```{r}
# Calculate average mpg by number of cylinders
mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarize(avg_mpg = mean(mpg))

# Multiple summary statistics
mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarize(
    count = n(),              # count of cars
    avg_mpg = mean(mpg),      # average mpg
    max_hp = max(hp),         # maximum horsepower
    avg_weight = mean(wt)     # average weight
  )

# Group by multiple variables
mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl, gear) %>%
  summarize(
    count = n(),
    avg_mpg = mean(mpg))

```

### Putting it all together

Here's a more complex example that combines multiple `dplyr` functions:

```{r}
# Analyze efficient cars (>20 mpg) by cylinder count
efficient_car_analysis <- mtcars %>%
  filter(mpg > 20) %>%                    # only efficient cars
  mutate(hp_per_weight = hp / wt) %>%     # create efficiency ratio
  group_by(cyl) %>%                       # group by cylinders
  summarize(
    car_count = n(),
    avg_mpg = round(mean(mpg), 1),
    avg_hp = round(mean(hp), 1),
    avg_efficiency = round(mean(hp_per_weight), 2)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_mpg))                  # sort by mpg

efficient_car_analysis
```

## Data Wrangling with `tidyr`

![](fig/tidyr.png)

`tidyr` helps you reshape your data. Most analysis and visualization functions expect data in a specific format, so knowing how to reshape data is crucial.

### Long vs wide data

Data can be organized in two main ways:

**Wide data**: Each variable has its own column
```
Country   2018   2019   2020
USA       100    110    105
Canada     90     95     92
```

**Long data**: Each observation is a separate row
```
Country   Year   Value
USA       2018   100
USA       2019   110
USA       2020   105
Canada    2018    90
Canada    2019    95
Canada    2020    92
```

Different analyses and plots require different formats:

- **Wide format** is easier for humans to read and for some statistical tests
- **Long format** is better for plotting with `ggplot2` and for many statistical analyses

### Pivot functions

`tidyr` provides two main functions for reshaping data:

- `pivot_longer()` - converts wide data to long data
- `pivot_wider()` - converts long data to wide data

Many tidyverse functions, like `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`, result in a **tibble** instead of a regular data frame.

**What is a tibble?**  
A tibble is a modern version of a data frame. It looks and behaves almost the same, but:

- It prints more nicely in the console (shows only the first 10 rows and columns that fit your screen)
- It never changes the type of your data (no automatic conversion of strings to factors)
- It’s often more consistent and user-friendly for data analysis

Most tidyverse functions work best with tibbles, and you can use tibbles almost everywhere you’d use a data frame.

You can check if your data is a tibble by using the `class()` function. If you see something like `<tbl_df>`, `<tibble>`, or `[tibble]` when you print your data, you’re working with a tibble.

If you ever need a classic data frame (for example, for a function that doesn’t accept tibbles), you can convert it easily:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Convert a tibble to a data frame
grades_long_df <- as.data.frame(grades_long)
```

Now, let’s look at how to reshape data using `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`.

Let's create some example data to practice with:

```{r}
# Create sample wide data (grades for different subjects)
grades_wide <- data.frame(
  student = c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Diana"),
  math = c(85, 78, 92, 88),
  science = c(90, 82, 89, 94),
  english = c(88, 85, 78, 91)
)
grades_wide
```

### Pivoting Longer

`pivot_longer()` takes multiple columns and combines them into two columns: one for the variable names and one for the values.

```{r}
# Convert wide to long
grades_long <- grades_wide %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(math, science, english),    # columns to pivot
    names_to = "subject",                # name for the new "names" column
    values_to = "grade"                  # name for the new "values" column
  )
grades_long

# Alternative syntax - select columns by position or pattern
grades_wide %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -student,           # all columns except student
    names_to = "subject",
    values_to = "grade"
  )

# Or use column positions
grades_wide %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = 2:4,               # columns 2 through 4
    names_to = "subject", 
    values_to = "grade"
  )
```

Now we can do some statistics. 

```{r}
# We can easily calculate average grades by subject
grades_long %>%
  group_by(subject) %>%
  summarize(avg_grade = mean(grade))

# Or find the best student in each subject
grades_long %>%
  group_by(subject) %>%
  slice_max(grade, n = 1)  # get the top grade in each subject
```

### Pivoting Wider

`pivot_wider()` does the opposite--it takes two columns and spreads them into multiple columns.

```{r}
# Convert back to wide format
grades_back_to_wide <- grades_long %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = subject,     # column containing new column names
    values_from = grade       # column containing values
  )
grades_back_to_wide

# Let's create a more complex example
# Student performance over time
performance <- data.frame(
  student = rep(c("Alice", "Bob"), each = 3),
  quarter = rep(c("Q1", "Q2", "Q3"), times = 2),
  grade = c(85, 87, 90, 78, 80, 83)
)
performance

# Pivot wider to see each quarter as a column
performance_wide <- performance %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = quarter,
    values_from = grade
  )
performance_wide
```



### Questions that warrant different data structures

**Use wide format when you want to:**

- Compare values across categories side by side
- Calculate correlations between variables
- Create certain types of tables for reports
- Use functions that expect each variable in its own column

**Use long format when you want to:**

- Create plots with `ggplot2` (especially when you want to color/group by category)
- Calculate statistics by group
- Use functions that work with grouping variables
- Perform operations on multiple columns at once

```{r}
# Example: When would you use each format?

# Wide format is good for correlation analysis
cor(grades_wide[, -1])  # correlation between subjects (excluding student names)

# Long format is good for grouped analysis
grades_long %>%
  group_by(subject) %>%
  summarize(
    avg_grade = mean(grade),
    min_grade = min(grade),
    max_grade = max(grade),
    grade_range = max_grade - min_grade
  )
```


## Saving Your Results and Outputs

Now that you’ve learned how to manipulate and reshape data, it’s important to know how to **save your results** for future use or sharing. This is why we set up folders like `output/` and `figures/` at the start.

### Saving and loading a dataset

Often, you’ll want to save a cleaned or summarized dataset so you (or others) can use it later, or open it in another program like Excel.  

- **`write.csv()`** saves a data frame to a CSV (comma-separated values) file on your computer.
- **`read.csv()`** loads a CSV file back into R as a data frame.

**Example:**

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Save a data frame to a CSV file
write.csv(my_data, file = "output/my_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# Later, or in a new R session, you can load it back:
my_loaded_data <- read.csv("output/my_data.csv")
```

- The `file` argument is the path and filename where you want to save or load your data.
- `row.names = FALSE` is often used to avoid saving row numbers as an extra column.

### Saving plots as image files

You can also save your plots as image files (like PNG or JPEG) so you can use them in reports, presentations, or share them with others.

To save a plot you will need to open a **graphics device**. This is a way to tell R to create an image file instead of displaying the plot in the RStudio Plots pane.

This is a three-step process:

1. **Open a graphics device** (like `png()` or `jpeg()`) and give it a file name.

   - This tells R: "Get ready to save a plot as an image file"
   - You specify the filename and image type (PNG, JPEG, etc.)

2. **Create your plot as usual** with functions like `plot()` or `barplot()`

   - Your plot won't appear in RStudio's Plots pane
   - Instead, it's being "drawn" into the image file

3. **Close the device** with `dev.off()` to finish saving the file

   - This tells R: "I'm done drawing, please save and close the image file"
   - **Important:** Don't forget this step or your file won't be saved properly!

R needs to know when you start and stop creating the image file. It's like telling R "start recording" → do your work → "stop recording and save."

**Example:**

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Save a plot as a PNG image
png("figures/my_plot.png", width = 600, height = 400)
plot(mtcars$hp, mtcars$mpg)
dev.off()
```

- The plot will be saved in your `figures/` folder as `my_plot.png`.
- You won’t see the plot in your RStudio Plots pane when saving this way, but you can open the image file to view it.


Let’s create a new dataset from `mtcars` that only includes cars with high fuel efficiency, and save it as a CSV file in your `output/` folder.

```{r}
# Create a new dataset: cars with mpg > 25
efficient_cars <- filter(mtcars, mpg > 25)

# Save to CSV in the output folder
write.csv(efficient_cars, file = "output/efficient_cars.csv", row.names = TRUE)
```

Now you’ll find a file called `efficient_cars.csv` in your `output/` folder!


### Saving a basic plot

Let’s make a simple plot and save it to your `figures/` folder. (We’ll cover plotting in depth in the next workshop.)

```{r}
# Create a basic scatter plot and save it as a PNG
png("figures/mpg_vs_hp.png", width = 600, height = 400)
plot(mtcars$hp, mtcars$mpg,
     main = "Fuel Efficiency vs Horsepower",
     xlab = "Horsepower",
     ylab = "Miles per Gallon",
     col = "blue", pch = 19)
dev.off()
```

This creates a file called `mpg_vs_hp.png` in your `figures/` folder.



### Saving a summary table

You can also save summary statistics or tables:

```{r}
# Create a summary table: average mpg by number of cylinders
mpg_by_cyl <- mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarize(avg_mpg = mean(mpg))

# Save the summary table as a CSV
write.csv(mpg_by_cyl, file = "output/mpg_by_cyl.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```


**Tip:**  
Always check your `output/` and `figures/` folders after running your code to make sure your files were saved as expected!


## Exercises

Let's practice what we've learned with some exercises. Be sure to create a script for your code and save your results!

### Exercise 1: Basic dplyr operations

Using the `mtcars` dataset create varibles to answer the following questions:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# 1. Select only the columns: mpg, cyl, hp, and wt
# Your code here:

# 2. Filter cars that have more than 6 cylinders AND more than 200 horsepower  
# Your code here:

# 3. Create a new column called "power_to_weight" (hp divided by wt)
# Your code here:

# 4. Arrange cars by mpg from highest to lowest
# Your code here:

# 5. Count how many cars have each number of cylinders
# Your code here:

# 6. Save your power_to_weight dataset as a CSV file in your output folder
# Your code here:
```

### Exercise 2: Pipes and grouped analysis

Using the `mtcars` dataset, create a new dateset with the following parameters using pipes:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Using the mtcars dataset, use pipes to:
# 1. Filter cars with mpg > 15
# 2. Create a new column hp_per_weight = hp/wt  
# 3. Group by number of cylinders
# 4. Summarize to get: count of cars, average mpg, average hp_per_weight
# 5. Arrange by average mpg
# 6. Save this summary table as "cylinder_analysis.csv" in your output folder

# Your code here:
```

### Exercise 3: Pivoting practice and plotting

Create this dataset and practice pivoting:

```{r}
# Temperature data for different cities
temp_data <- data.frame(
  city = c("Las Vegas", "Reno", "Carson City"),
  jan = c(45, 32, 35),
  apr = c(65, 55, 58),
  jul = c(95, 85, 88),
  oct = c(70, 60, 63)
)
temp_data
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# 1. Convert this wide data to long format
# Call the new columns "month" and "temperature"
# Your code here:

# 2. From your long format data, calculate the average temperature for each month
# Your code here:

# 3. Save your long format temperature data as "temp_long.csv"
# Your code here:
```
